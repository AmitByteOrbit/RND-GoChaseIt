#### Lidar and camera sensors.
I have used the Hokuyo Lidar with the Kinect Camera. I wanted to use point clouds for the ball detection but ran out of time. Luckily the camera worked well :)

#### Gazebo plugins for the robotâ€™s differential drive, lidar, and camera.
I have used the `skid_steer_drive_controller` with four wheels.

#### Housed inside the world
I have used the world from my previous project. 

#### Significant changes from the sample taught in the project lesson.
I think it is much different from the sample taught in the project lesson :)

#### Robot is stable when moving
yes
